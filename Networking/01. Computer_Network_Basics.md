# 🌐 Computer Networks Basics

## 🔹 Computer Network
A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) that share resources and exchange data using communication channels.

---

## 🔹 Internet
The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computer networks that communicate using the **TCP/IP protocol**.

- **ARPANET** – The first network project that eventually led to the Internet.  
- **WWW (World Wide Web)** – Invented by **Tim Berners-Lee** in 1989.  
- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** – The address of a resource on the Internet.  
- **Search Engine** – A tool that helps find information on the web (e.g., Google, Bing).

## 🔹 Protocols
Protocols are a set of rules that define how data is transmitted across networks. Managed by the **Internet Society**.

---

## 🔹 Client-Server Architecture
A model where:  
**Client ↔ Server ↔ Client**  
- The client requests a service.  
- The server provides the requested service.

## 🔹 How Data is Transferred
- **Packets** – Data is divided into small chunks before transmission.  
- **IP Addressing** – ISP provides a **Global IP** to the modem, which assigns **Private IPs** to devices using **DHCP**.  
- **Ports** – 16-bit numbers used to identify services on a device (Total ≈ 65,000).  
  - **0–1023** → Reserved Ports  
  - **1024–49152** → Registered for special applications  
  - **49153–65535** → Dynamic / Private use  
- **Transmission Media**  
  - **Guided** (Wired: cables like twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic)  
  - **Unguided** (Wireless: radio waves, microwaves, infrared)

## 🔹 Types of Networks
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Covers a small area like a home, office.  
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – Covers a city or large campus.  
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Covers large geographical areas (e.g., Internet).

## 🔹 Network Devices

### 🔁 Repeater
- Operates at the **Physical Layer**.  
- Regenerates signals to extend transmission distance.  
- A 2-port device.  

### 📥 Hub
- A **multi-port repeater**.  
- Connects multiple devices but cannot filter data.  
- Types: **Active Hub**, **Passive Hub**.  

### 🌉 Bridge
- Operates at the **Data Link Layer**.  
- Filters traffic based on **MAC addresses**.  
- Connects two LANs using the same protocol.  
- Types: **Transparent Bridge**, **Source Routing Bridge**.  

### 🔀 Switch
- A **multi-port bridge** with buffering and error checking.  
- Operates at the **Data Link Layer**.  
- Improves efficiency compared to a hub.  

### 📡 Router
- Operates at the **Network Layer**.  
- Routes packets based on **IP addresses**.  
- Connects multiple LANs and WANs.  

### 🚪 Gateway
- Connects two different networks (may use different protocols).  
- Translates data between them.  

### 🔄 Brouter
- A hybrid of **Bridge + Router**.  
- Can operate at the Data Link Layer or Network Layer.  

### 📞 Modem
- Converts **Digital signals ↔ Analog signals** for Internet access.

## 🔹 Network Topologies
- **Bus Topology** – All devices share a common communication line.  
- **Ring Topology** – Each device connected in a circular fashion.  
- **Star Topology** – Devices connected through a central hub/switch.  
- **Tree Topology** – Combination of bus and star topologies.  
- **Mesh Topology** – Every device connected to every other device (full redundancy).
