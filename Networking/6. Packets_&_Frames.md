# 📦 Intro to Packets and Frames

In networking, **packets** and **frames** are small units of data that, when combined, form a complete message.  
They serve similar purposes but exist at **different layers** of the **OSI model**:

- **Packets** 📨 → Work at the **Network Layer** (IP-level communication).  
- **Frames** 🔗 → Work at the **Data Link Layer** (MAC-level communication).

## 📌 Packets (IP Layer)
When data is sent using IP, it is wrapped into a **packet**.  
Each packet contains a **header** (control information) + **data** (the actual content).  

### 🔑 Common Packet Headers
| Header               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time to Live (TTL)** ⏳ | Prevents packets from looping endlessly. It decreases by 1 at each hop and is dropped when it hits zero. |
| **Checksum** ✅        | Ensures data integrity. If corrupted, the checksum won’t match and the packet is discarded. |
| **Source Address** 📤 | IP address of the sender device (so the receiver knows where to reply). |
| **Destination Address** 📥 | IP address of the intended receiver device (so the packet knows where to go). |

## 📌 Frames (Data Link Layer)
- Frames are the **physical representation of data** transmitted over a medium (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi).  
- They contain **MAC addresses** of the sender and receiver, ensuring data can travel across local networks.
