# 🧩 Subnetting, CIDR & ARP Basics

## 📌 Subnetting  
**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sections called **subnets**.  
It helps organize IP addresses and improves network efficiency.  

Subnetting uses IP addresses in **three main ways**:  

| 🔑 Type            | 🎯 Purpose                                | 📝 Explanation                                                                 | 💻 Example       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Network Address** | Marks the starting point of the network.  | Tells devices which network they belong to.                                     | `192.168.1.0`   |
| **Host Address**    | Identifies a specific device.             | Every device gets a unique host address.                                        | `192.168.1.100` |
| **Default Gateway** | Directs traffic outside the subnet.       | Sends data to other networks (like the Internet). Often `.1` or `.254`.         | `192.168.1.254` |

## 📝 CIDR Notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)  
CIDR is a method for **allocating IP addresses** and **routing** more flexibly than old class-based systems.  

Example:  
- `192.168.1.0/24` → covers the range `192.168.1.0 – 192.168.1.255`  
- `/24` means **24 bits are reserved for the network** and the rest for hosts.

## 🔗 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)  
ARP links **IP addresses** to their matching **MAC addresses**, so devices can communicate properly.  

📌 How ARP Works:  
1. Each device keeps an **ARP cache** (table of IP-to-MAC mappings).  
2. When a device wants to talk to another:  
   - **ARP Request** 📡 → “Who has this IP address?” (broadcasted).  
   - **ARP Reply** 📨 → The device with that IP responds with its MAC address.  

This ensures data is sent to the **right physical device** on the network.
