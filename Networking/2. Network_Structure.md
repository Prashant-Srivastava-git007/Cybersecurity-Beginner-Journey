# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 2: Structure of Network

## Architectures
- **Client-Server Architecture** â€“ Clients request services and servers provide responses.  
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture** â€“ Each device (peer) acts as both client and server.

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
Defines how computers communicate over the internet.  
It has **7 layers**:

1. **Application Layer**  
   - Provides applications which help users interact with the internet (e.g., web browsers).  
   - **Communication Flow**: Program â†’ Processes â†’ Threads â†’ Sockets â†’ Internet  
   - **Protocols**:  
     - **HTTP** â€“ Defines how data is transferred between client and server. Uses TCP. Stateless protocol.  
     - **DHCP** â€“ Allocates IP addresses to devices on the network.  
     - **FTP** â€“ Transfers files.  
     - **SMTP** â€“ Sends email.  
     - **POP3 & IMAP** â€“ Receive email.  
     - **SSH** â€“ Secure shell for remote terminal login.  
     - **VNC** â€“ Graphical remote control.  
     - **Telnet** â€“ Remote connection using terminal emulator.  
     - **DNS** â€“ Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  

2. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Ensures data is in a readable format (encryption, compression, translation).  

3. **Session Layer**  
   - Manages communication sessions between applications.  

4. **Transport Layer**  
   - Provides abstraction for sending data to the network layer.  
   - Adds socket port numbers, handles flow control (congestion) and error detection (checksums).  
   - **Protocols**:  
     - **TCP** â€“ Connection-oriented, guarantees delivery.  
     - **UDP** â€“ Connectionless, faster but delivery not guaranteed.  

5. **Network Layer**  
   - Handles logical addressing and routing using **routers**.  
   - **Routing**:  
     - Static Routing  
     - Dynamic Routing  
   - **Middleboxes**:  
     - **Firewall** â€“ Filters packets (stateless or stateful).  
     - **NAT** â€“ Maps private IPs to public IPs during packet transit.  
   - **Protocol**:  
     - **IP (Internet Protocol)** â€“ IPv4 (2^32 addresses) and IPv6 (2^128 addresses).  

6. **Data Link Layer**  
   - Transmits **frames** over a physical link. Handles MAC addressing and error detection.  

7. **Physical Layer**  
   - Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over physical mediums (cables, radio waves).

## TCP/IP Model (Internet Protocol Suite)
Has **5 layers**:  
1. Application Layer â€“ Data in form of messages  
2. Transport Layer â€“ Data in form of segments  
3. Network Layer â€“ Data in form of packets  
4. Data Link Layer â€“ Data in form of frames  
5. Physical Layer â€“ Data in form of bits

## ðŸ”„ TCP 3-Way Handshake
1. Client sends **SYN** flag with sequence number to server.  
2. Server responds with **SYN-ACK** (acknowledgement + sequence number).  
3. Client replies with **ACK**, completing the connection.

## Classes of IP Addresses
- **Class A** â†’ 0.0.0.0 â€“ 127.255.255.255  
- **Class B** â†’ 128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.255.255  
- **Class C** â†’ 192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.255  
- **Class D** â†’ 224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)  
- **Class E** â†’ 240.0.0.0 â€“ 255.255.255.255 (Experimental)  

---

## Subnet Masking
- Used to divide an IP address into **network ID** and **host ID**.  
- Example: `255.255.255.0` means first 3 octets = network, last octet = host.
