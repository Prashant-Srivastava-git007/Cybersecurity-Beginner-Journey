# 🔑 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Every device on a network must have an **IP address** to communicate. DHCP automates this process so users don’t need to configure IPs manually.

## 📌 Methods of IP Assignment
1. **Static IP** 📝  
   - IP address is assigned **manually**.  
   - Useful for servers, printers, or devices that need a fixed address.  

2. **Dynamic IP** ⚡  
   - IP address is **automatically assigned** by a DHCP server.  
   - Most common for everyday devices like laptops and smartphones.

## 🔄 How DHCP Works (DORA Process)
The DHCP handshake is also called **DORA**:  

1. **Discover** 🔍 – Device broadcasts a request to find DHCP servers.  
2. **Offer** 📩 – DHCP server replies with an available IP address.  
3. **Request** 🙋 – Device requests to use the offered IP.  
4. **Acknowledge (ACK)** ✅ – Server confirms and leases the IP to the device.  

Now, the device can start communicating on the network.

## 🖥️ Verifying DHCP Configuration
- On **Windows**:  
  ```bash
  ipconfig /all
  ```

## 📚 Key DHCP Concepts

**DHCP Scope 🎯**

The range of IP addresses the DHCP server can assign.

Example: 192.168.1.100 – 192.168.1.200.

**DHCP Lease ⏳**

IP addresses are given temporarily.

A lease might last 1 day, after which the device must renew it.

Prevents addresses from being wasted.

**DHCP Reservations 📌**

Ensures a specific device always receives the same IP.

Ties a device’s MAC address to a chosen IP.

Example: A server always needs the same IP for stability.
