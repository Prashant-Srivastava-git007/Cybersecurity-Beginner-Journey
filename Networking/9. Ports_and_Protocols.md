# ðŸ”Œ Understanding Ports in Networking

**Protocol** is a set of rules that defines how data is **formatted, transmitted, and received** across a network.  
Think of it as a **common language** that devices use to communicate with each other.  

**Ports** are virtual access points that allow data to **enter or exit a device**.  
They are identified by numbers ranging from **0 â€“ 65535**.  

- **0 â€“ 1023** â†’ Well-known or common ports  
- **1024 â€“ 49151** â†’ Registered ports (for specific applications)  
- **49152 â€“ 65535** â†’ Dynamic/private ports (temporary use by applications)
