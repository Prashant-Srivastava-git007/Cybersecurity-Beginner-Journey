# 🌐 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**TCP** is one of the key protocols in networking that manages **how data is sent between devices**.  
It is **connection-based**, meaning a connection must be established before data is exchanged.  
This ensures **reliable and ordered delivery** of data.

## 🤝 TCP Connection Setup: The Three-Way Handshake
Before sending data, TCP establishes a connection using the **three-way handshake**:

| Step | Message  | Description                                                                 |
|------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **SYN**  | Sent by the client to initiate the connection and start synchronization.   |
| 2    | **SYN/ACK** | Sent by the server to acknowledge the client’s request.                  |
| 3    | **ACK**  | Sent by the client to confirm and complete the connection setup.           |
| 4    | **DATA** | After the handshake, actual data (e.g., file bytes) is transmitted.        |
| 5    | **FIN**  | Sent to cleanly close the connection when communication ends.              |
| #    | **RST**  | Used to abruptly end a connection in case of errors or problems.           |

## 📝 Important TCP Headers
Each TCP segment contains **headers** that carry vital information:

| Header                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Port** 🔢       | Randomly chosen port on the sender’s device.                              |
| **Destination Port** 🎯  | Port number on the receiver’s device (e.g., port 80 for web traffic).      |
| **Source IP** 🌍         | IP address of the sending device.                                          |
| **Destination IP** 📬    | IP address of the receiving device.                                        |
| **Sequence Number** 🔄   | Tracks the order of packets so they arrive correctly.                      |
| **Acknowledgement Number** ✅ | Confirms receipt of data and readiness for the next packet.             |
| **Checksum** ✔️          | Ensures data integrity (detects corruption).                              |
| **Data (Payload)** 📦    | The actual content being transmitted.                                      |
| **Flags** 🚩             | Special instructions (used in handshakes and connection control).          |
