# 📡 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**UDP** is a communication protocol used to send data between devices, similar to TCP but with **key differences**:

- ✅ **Faster** than TCP because it skips connection setup.  
- ❌ **Unreliable** because it does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-checking.  
- 🔄 Often used for real-time applications where **speed matters more than reliability**, such as:  
  - Online gaming 🎮  
  - Video/audio streaming 📺🎵  
  - VoIP calls 📞  

Unlike TCP, UDP is **stateless** — it doesn’t require a handshake and doesn’t track whether data is successfully received.

## 📦 UDP Packet Structure

Each UDP packet contains a small header and data.  

| Header               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Port** 🔢    | Temporary port number the sender uses to send the data.                    |
| **Destination Port** 🎯 | Port number of the receiving application (e.g., port 53 for DNS).          |
| **Source Address** 🌍 | IP address of the sender device.                                           |
| **Destination Address** 📬 | IP address of the receiver device.                                      |
| **Data (Payload)** 📦 | The actual content being transmitted.                                      |
