# 🌐 Introduction to DNS (Domain Name System)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** acts like the **phonebook of the Internet**.  
It translates human-readable **domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into numerical **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.14`) that computers use to communicate.  

Without DNS, we’d have to remember IP addresses for every website instead of simple names.

## 🔄 How DNS Resolution Works

When you type a website address in your browser, DNS resolves it into an IP address through several steps:

1. **Local Cache Check** 🖥️  
   - Your browser or operating system first checks its **local cache** to see if it already knows the IP.  
   - If not found, it forwards the request to a **DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP).  

2. **Resolver Server** 📡  
   - The resolver checks its own cache.  
   - If it doesn’t know the answer, it asks the **root name servers**.  

3. **Root Name Servers** 🌍  
   - These are the highest-level DNS servers, located worldwide.  
   - They don’t store exact IPs but direct the resolver to the correct **Top-Level Domain (TLD) server** (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).  

4. **TLD Server** 🏷️  
   - Handles domains under a specific extension.  
   - Example: The `.com` TLD server directs the query to the authoritative server for `espn.com`.  

5. **Authoritative Name Server** 🏛️  
   - The final stop — this server contains the actual DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, etc.).  
   - It responds with the correct **IP address** of the domain.  
   - The resolver passes this back to your computer, which then connects to the website.
