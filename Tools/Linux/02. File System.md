# 📁 Linux File System & Navigation Commands

In Linux, **everything is treated as a file** — including commands, devices, and configurations. Understanding the file system structure and navigation commands is key to mastering Linux.

## 📂 Key Directories in Linux

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/bin`    | Essential user binaries (commands like `ls`, `cp`, `cat`) |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries for admin (e.g., `reboot`, `ifconfig`) — used with `sudo` |
| `/home`   | Contains personal folders for each user (e.g., `/home/prashant`) |
| `/dev`    | Virtual files representing physical devices (e.g., hard drives, USBs) |
| `/etc`    | System-wide configuration files (network, services, users) |
| `/media`  | Auto-mounted external storage (USB, CDs) |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems |

---

## 🧭 Basic File Commands

| Command | Use | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `cp` | Copy files | `cp file.txt /home/user/` |
| `mv` | Move/rename files | `mv file.txt /home/user/` |
| `rm` | Delete a file | `rm file.txt` |
| `mkdir` | Create a directory | `mkdir myfolder` |
| `rmdir` | Remove an empty directory | `rmdir myfolder` |
| `rm -r` | Delete directory with contents | `rm -r myfolder` |
| `file` | Check file type | `file image.png` |

---

## 🔍 Finding and Searching Files

### 🔎 Using `find`

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find file by name | `find / -name filename.txt` |
| Find files by extension | `find / -name "*.pdf"` |

### 🔎 Using `grep`

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Search for text in file | `grep "text_to_search" file.txt` |
| Case-insensitive search | `grep -i "text" file.txt` |
| Recursive search in folder | `grep -r "password" /etc` |

> 💡 Tip: Combine `find` + `grep` to locate and scan files efficiently.

# 🔐 Linux File Permissions & Ownership

Linux uses a robust permission model to control access to files and directories. Understanding how to manage file permissions is essential for maintaining security in a Linux environment.

---

## 📋 Viewing File Permissions

To view permissions of files and directories, use:

`ls -l`
`This displays: File type and permissions Owner and group File size, date, and name`

---

## ✍️ Changing Permissions with `chmod`

### 🔤 Permission Characters:

* `r` – Read

* `w` – Write

* `x` – Execute

* `-` – No permission

### 👤 User Types:

* `u` – User (owner)

* `g` – Group

* `o` – Others

* `a` – All (user, group, others)

✅ Symbolic Syntax:

`chmod [user_type]+[permissions] file_name`   # Add permission

`chmod [user_type]-[permissions] file_name`   # Remove permission

---

### 🔁 Recursively Changing Permissions

To apply permissions to all files and subfolders inside a directory:

`chmod -R u=rwx testdir/`

---

### 🔢 Numeric (Octal) Method

| Number | Permission | Description |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `0` | `---` | No permissions |
| `1` | `--x` | Execute only |
| `2` | `-w-` | Write only |
| `4` | `r--` | Read only |
| `7` | `rwx` | Full permission |

Example: `chmod 777 file.sh`

---

## 👑 Managing File Ownership 

### 🔁 Switch Users

Switches to another user (if allowed) `su username`

### 🔧 Change File Owner and Group `chown user:group file_name`

Example: `chown prashant:developers report.txt` Sets user to `prashant` and group to `devlopers`

### 🔧 Change Only Group `chgrp group_name file_name`

Example: `chgrp admins config.ini`
