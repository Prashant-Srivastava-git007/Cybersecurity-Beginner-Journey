# 🔓 By-Pass Security Devices (IDS 🛡, IPS 🛡, Firewall 🔥, Antivirus 🦠)

 📌 Goal: Identify if ports marked as filtered are actually open or not, while keeping your IP safe during scanning. This method is known as Invasion Technique.

 ## 1️⃣ Stealth Scan 🕵️‍♂️
 🔹 Also called Half-Open Scan – First sends SYN packet, waits for SYN+ACK to confirm the port is open.
 
💻 Command:  ``nmap -sS <Target-IP>``

📊 With Wireshark:

If found SYN+ACK → ✅ Port is open

If found RST → ❌ Port is closed

## 2️⃣ Xmas Scan 🎄

🔹 -sX – Sends TCP packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags lit up like Christmas lights 🎅.

---

## 3️⃣ FIN Scan 🚪

🔹 -sF – Sends FIN packets to evade simple firewall rules.

---

## 4️⃣ Timing & Performance Scan ⏱

🔹 Used in large networks where security devices are implemented. Adjusts the packet sending speed (0-5 levels).

💻 Command:  ``nmap <Target-IP> -T<0-5>``

---

## 5️⃣ Spoofing MAC Address 🖧

* Random: ``nmap --spoof-mac 0 <Target-IP>``
* Manual: ``nmap --spoof-mac <MAC-ADDRESS> <Target-IP>``
* Vendor Specific: ``nmap --spoof-mac dell <Target-IP>``

---

## 6️⃣ Decoy Scan 🌀

🔹 Sends packets from multiple fake IPs to confuse IDS / Firewalls.
* Random Decoy: ``nmap -sS -D RND:2 <Target-IP>``
* Selected IPs: ``nmap -sS -D <IP1>,<IP2> <Target-IP>``

---

## 7️⃣ Changing Packet Size 📦

* MTU Scan: ``nmap --mtu <size> <Target-IP>``  (size must be multiple of 8)
* Fragmentation Scan: ``nmap -f <Target-IP>``

---

## 8️⃣ Idle IP / Zombie Scan 🧟

🔹 Uses an idle vulnerable system to perform scanning without revealing your real IP.

### Steps 

* In Metasploit:
  ```
  1. search idle_ip
  2. use 0
  3. show options
  4. set rhosts <network-range>
  5. exploit
  ```

* In Linux:
  ```
  nmap -sI <Idle-IP> <Target-IP>
  ```

## 9️⃣ Spoof Source Port Scan 🚢

🔹 Bypass restrictions by using allowed ports.
💻 Command: ``nmap --source-port <Port-NO> <Target-IP>``
