# 🕵️‍♂️ Network Scanning – Beginner Guide

**Network Scanning** is the process of gathering information about a network, such as:
- Identifying active devices (hosts)
- Finding open or closed ports
- Detecting running services
- Identifying the operating system
- Checking active processes

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Identify **live hosts** on the network  
2. Find **open and closed ports**  
3. Detect **services** running on the network  
4. Identify **operating system** details  
5. Discover **active processes**

## 🌐 TCP vs UDP (Transport Layer Protocols)
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
  - *Connection-oriented*: First a connection is established, then data is sent.  
  - Reliable, ensures data is delivered in order.  

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  
  - *Connection-less*: Sends packets (datagrams) without establishing a connection.  
  - Faster, but less reliable (no delivery guarantee).

## 🤝 TCP 3-Way Handshake
The process TCP uses to establish a connection:

1. **Client → SYN → Server**  
   *(Client requests a connection)*  
2. **Server → SYN-ACK → Client**  
   *(Server acknowledges and responds)*  
3. **Client → ACK → Server**  
   *(Client confirms, connection established)*

## 📑 TCP Header

## 🚩 TCP Flags
- **SYN** – Start a connection  
- **ACK** – Acknowledge received data  
- **URG** – Urgent data, process immediately  
- **PSH** – Push buffered data immediately  
- **FIN** – Finish connection  
- **RST** – Reset/abort connection
