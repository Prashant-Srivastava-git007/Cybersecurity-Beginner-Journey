# 📡 Nmap – Beginner Guide

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is an **open-source network scanning tool** used for discovering devices, open ports, and services on a network.  
It comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows and macOS.

## 🔍 Check if a Host is Live
To simply check if a host is active (without scanning ports):

```bash
nmap -sn <IP-Address>
```

> 💡 Tip: If ICMP ping (default method) is blocked by the host, use ARP ping instead: 
```bash
sudo nmap -sn <IP-Address> -PR
```

## 🌍 Traceroute with Nmap

Traceroute helps track the network path between your system and the target:

```
nmap -sn --traceroute <IP-Address or Website>
```
## ⚡ Skipping or Changing DNS Resolution

* Skip DNS resolution:
  ```
  nmap -n xyz.com
  ```
* Use custom DNS server (e.g., Cloudflare):
  ```
  nmap xyz.com --dns-servers 1.1.1.1
  ```

## 🚫 Scan Without Ping

  Treat host as alive without sending ICMP packets:
  ```
  nmap -Pn <target>
  ```

## 📊 Port States

* **Open:** Port is active and accepting connections.

* **Closed:** Port is not active.

* **Filtered:** Firewall/IDS blocking probes; state unknown.

* **Unfiltered:** Probes received, but state unknown.

* **Open/Filtered:** Could be open or filtered.

* **Closed/Filtered:** Could be closed or filtered.
