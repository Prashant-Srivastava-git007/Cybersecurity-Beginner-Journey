# 📡 Nmap – Beginner Guide

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is an **open-source network scanning tool** used for discovering devices, open ports, and services on a network.  
It comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows and macOS.

## 🔍 Check if a Host is Live
To simply check if a host is active (without scanning ports):

```bash
nmap -sn <IP-Address>
```

> 💡 Tip: If ICMP ping (default method) is blocked by the host, use ARP ping instead: 
```bash
sudo nmap -sn <IP-Address> -PR
```

## 🌍 Traceroute with Nmap

Traceroute helps track the network path between your system and the target:

```
nmap -sn --traceroute <IP-Address or Website>
```
