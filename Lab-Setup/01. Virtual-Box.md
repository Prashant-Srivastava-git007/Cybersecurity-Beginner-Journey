# 🖥️ VirtualBox – Introduction & Installation Guide

## 🌍 What is VirtualBox?
**VirtualBox** is an **open-source virtualization software** developed by **Oracle**.  
It allows you to run **multiple operating systems (OS)** — called **virtual machines (VMs)** — on a single physical computer.  

👉 All virtual machines **share the hardware resources** (like CPU, RAM, and storage) of your physical system.

## ⚙️ Why Use VirtualBox?
- 🖥️ Test different operating systems (like Linux, Windows, macOS).  
- 🔐 Practice cybersecurity in a safe, isolated environment.  
- 🚀 Run servers or tools without affecting your main system.  
- 💻 Ideal for students, developers, and security enthusiasts.
