# 🌐 pfSense – Initial Network Configuration in VirtualBox

After completing the installation and rebooting **pfSense**, follow these steps to configure its network interfaces.

---

## 🟢 VLAN Setup
1. When prompted **“Do you want to set up VLANs now?”**, type: `n`
   - (The text may keep scrolling before you respond—don’t worry, just type `n`.)

---

## 🔧 Configure Network Interfaces
2. You’ll be asked to **name the interfaces**:
- `vtnet0` → **WAN**
- `vtnet1` → **LAN**
- `vtnet2` → **OPT1**

3. Type `y` to confirm the configuration.

## 🖧 Assign IP Addresses
4. We’ll leave the **WAN** IP unchanged but will configure **LAN** and **OPT1** manually.
5. Select option **2** from the menu: Set interface(s) IP Address

1 – WAN (vtnet0 – dhcp, dhcp6)
2 – LAN (vtnet1 – static)
3 – OPT1 (vtnet2)

6. Type `2` to configure the **LAN interface**:
- When asked, **“Configure IPv4 via DHCP?”**, type:
  ```
  n
  ```
- Enter the new **LAN IPv4 address**:
  ```
  10.0.1.1
  ```
- Subnet mask:  
  ```
  24
  ```
- Enable DHCP server on LAN:  
  ```
  y
  ```
- Enter the **DHCP IP range**:
  - Start: `10.0.1.11`
  - End: `10.0.1.245`  
    (This keeps some IPs free for static assignment.)
- When prompted at the end, type:
  ```
  n
  ```
  (No further configuration needed.)

## 🔁 Configure OPT1 Interface
7. Repeat the same steps for **OPT1 (vtnet2)**:
- IPv4 address: `10.0.3.1`
- Subnet mask: `24`
- DHCP range:
  - Start: `10.0.3.11`
  - End: `10.0.3.245`
- Follow the same process as for LAN.

## 🔻 Final Steps
8. Power off the system:
- Select option:
  ```
  6
  ```
  (Shut down pfSense VM.)

9. Remove the ISO file to avoid booting from it again:
- Go to **VirtualBox → Settings → Storage**  
- Select the **pfSense installer ISO**
- Click the **disk icon dropdown → “Remove disk from virtual drive”**

---

## ✅ Setup Complete!
You’ve now:
- Configured **WAN, LAN, and OPT1 interfaces**
- Assigned **static IPs** and **DHCP ranges**
- Removed the installation ISO

Your pfSense VM is ready for advanced configuration and network security labs 🚀.
