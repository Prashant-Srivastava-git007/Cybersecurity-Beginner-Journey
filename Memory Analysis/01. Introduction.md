## 🔍 What Is Memory Analysis?

Memory analysis involves examining volatile and semi-volatile memory files to find running processes, open network connections, malware traces, encryption keys, and more.
It is an essential step in incident response and digital forensics.

## 📌 Sources of Memory

### 1. **RAM**

* RAM is *volatile* memory — all data disappears when the system is powered off.
* It stores actively used data such as:

  * Running processes
  * OS components
  * Application data
  * Network activity
* Live RAM capture is extremely valuable because it shows what was happening **at that exact moment**.

---

### 2. **hiberfil.sys**

* Created when a system enters **Hibernation**.
* Stores the full contents of RAM so the system can resume later.
* Useful for:

  * Recovering past RAM state
  * Extracting system artifacts even when the system is off
* Found in `C:\hiberfil.sys`.

---

### 3. **pagefile.sys**

* Windows paging (virtual memory) file.
* Used when RAM is full — Windows moves less-used data here.
* Can contain:

  * Fragments of past RAM data
  * Credentials
  * Application artifacts
* Located at the root of the system drive.

---

### 4. **swapfile.sys**

* Another virtual memory file introduced in Windows 10 (1903+) and Windows 11.
* Used mainly for:

  * Modern/Universal Windows Apps
  * Compressed memory management
* Works together with `pagefile.sys` to extend RAM virtually.

## 🛠️ Capturing Memory (RAM Dump)

You can capture live system memory using tools like **DumpIt**.

### Example Command (DumpIt.exe)

```cmd
DumpIt.exe /OUTPUT C:\path\to\your\dump\memory.raw
```

This creates a full memory dump (`.raw`) that can be analyzed using tools like:

* Volatility / Volatility 3
* Rekall
* Magnet AXIOM
* FTK / EnCase (with plugins)
