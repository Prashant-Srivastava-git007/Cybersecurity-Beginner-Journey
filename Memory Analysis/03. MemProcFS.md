# 🧩 MemProcFS 

MemProcFS is a powerful **virtual file system for memory forensics**.
Released in **2022**, it changed how memory analysis is performed during **Incident Response (IR)**.

It mounts a memory dump (or live memory) as a **readable folder**, allowing you to explore processes, DLLs, handles, network artifacts, registry hives, and more — just like browsing normal files.

This makes memory forensics **faster, intuitive, and beginner-friendly**.

## ⭐ Key Features

* Mounts memory dumps as a **virtual file system**
* Explore memory using normal file operations (copy, open, read)
* View processes, modules, handles, network connections, registry, etc.
* Supports **raw dumps**, **DumpIt dumps**, **LiME**, and more
* Works great for IR, malware analysis, and DFIR training

## 📥 Installation

MemProcFS runs as a standalone tool — **no installation is required**.

### 1. Download

Download the latest version from the official source:

* **Velocidex / Ulf Frisk – MemProcFS GitHub**

Unzip it anywhere on your system:

```
MemProcFS/
│── MemProcFS.exe
│── dll/
│── plugins/
│── …
```

### 3. (Windows Only) Install WinFsp

MemProcFS needs **WinFsp** to mount the virtual file system.

* Search and download **WinFsp**
* Install it using default settings

## 🛠️ How to Use MemProcFS

### ▶️ Mount a Raw Memory Dump

```
MemProcFS.exe -device C:\Memory\dump.raw -forensic 1
```

### Flags Explained

| Flag          | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `-device`     | Path to memory dump file (raw/DumpIt/LiME) |
| `-forensic 1` | Ensures read-only safe forensic mode       |

After running the command, MemProcFS mounts a new virtual drive (e.g., **M:**).

## 📂 What You Can Explore Inside the Mounted Drive

Once mounted, open the new drive (example: **M:**) and you will see folders like:

```
M:\Processes\
M:\Handles\
M:\Network\
M:\Registry\
M:\Modules\
M:\SysInfo\
```

### Examples of What We Can Do

* **Check running processes**

  `M:\Processes\PID\`

* **View loaded DLLs**

  `M:\Processes\PID\Modules\`

* **Extract memory regions**

  `M:\Processes\PID\MemMap\`

* **Analyze registry hives**

  `M:\Registry\`

* **Check active network connections**

  `M:\Network\Connections.txt`
