# 🧭 Windows UserAssist Forensics Guide

UserAssist is a powerful Windows forensic artifact that reveals which GUI applications a user has opened, how often, and when. Although originally designed by Windows to improve user experience, it has become a valuable source of user activity evidence.

## 📌 What Are UserAssist Entries?

UserAssist entries are Windows Registry records that track the execution of GUI-based applications.

**They help forensic analysts understand:**
* Which applications were opened
* How frequently they were used
* When they were last executed
* User behavior patterns and activity timelines

These entries are useful in cases of insider threats, malware execution, and activity reconstruction.

## 📂 Registry Location

UserAssist data is found here:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist`


Inside this key, you’ll see multiple GUID-named subkeys.

Each GUID key contains values that track executed programs. These values are ROT13-encoded (a simple substitution cipher).

## 🔍 What Data Do UserAssist Entries Store?

**Each entry typically includes:**
* Executable Path – Where the program was launched from
* Execution Count – How many times it was opened
* Last Execution Timestamp
* ROT13-encoded Value Names

> ROT13 is easy to decode — many forensic tools do this automatically.

## 🗂 Common GUIDs Explained

| GUID                                     | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}` | Tracks accessed applications, files, and objects |
| `{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}` | Tracks shortcut links used to start programs     |

> These GUIDs help map how and from where applications were launched.
