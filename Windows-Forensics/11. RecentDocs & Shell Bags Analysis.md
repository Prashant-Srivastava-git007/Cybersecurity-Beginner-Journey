# 🗂️ Windows RecentDocs Analysis

RecentDocs is a valuable Windows forensic artifact that records recently accessed files and folders. It helps investigators understand user activity and reconstruct actions performed on a system.

---

## 📁 What Is RecentDocs?

RecentDocs is a Windows Registry key that stores the names of files and folders recently opened by the logged-in user.

**Registry Path:** `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs`

This key contains lists of recently accessed items organized by file extension (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`) and a general list for folders or mixed items.

---

## 🎯 Why RecentDocs Matters in Forensics

**RecentDocs can help investigators:**
* Identify recently opened files and documents
* Validate user activity, such as access to sensitive data
* Support cases involving intellectual property theft or data misuse
* Reconstruct timelines of document interaction

It is especially useful when examining what a user interacted with shortly before an incident.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

While powerful, RecentDocs has some constraints:

**🔹 Limited Storage**
* Only stores a fixed number of entries.
* Older records are overwritten as new items are accessed.
* Best for analyzing recent system activity.

**🔹 Can Be Cleared**
* Users can manually clear RecentDocs or use cleanup tools.
* System maintenance utilities may also erase these entries.
* Missing data may indicate intentional activity wiping.

# 🗂️ Shellbags Analysis

Shellbags are a powerful Windows forensic artifact used to understand which folders a user accessed, how they viewed them, and even whether the folders still exist. They can reveal user activity long after files or directories are deleted, making them extremely valuable during investigations.

---

## 📌 What Are Shellbags?

Shellbags are Windows Registry entries that store details about folders viewed in File Explorer.

**They record:**
* Folders accessed by the user
* Folder path structures (including deleted ones)
* View settings (icons, list, details, etc.)
* Window size and position
* Access to local, removable, and network directories

This makes Shellbags very useful for reconstructing user behavior, verifying hidden activity, and uncovering evidence of deleted folder access.

---

## 🧩 Why Shellbags Matter in Forensics

**Shellbags help investigators:**
* Identify folders opened by a user, even if the folder no longer exists
* Understand directory traversal patterns
* Recover previous paths of renamed, moved, or deleted folders
* Gain visibility into external drives or network shares accessed

They are often used in cases involving data hiding, unauthorized access, or evidence tampering.

---

## 📍 Shellbags Registry Locations

Shellbag data primarily exists in two registry paths:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags
```

* **BagMRU →** Stores folder hierarchy and MRU (Most Recently Used) information
* **Bags →** Stores view settings and metadata for each folder

## 🛠️ Tool: ShellBagsExplorer (Recommended)

A popular and beginner-friendly tool for analyzing Shellbags is ShellBagsExplorer (by Eric Zimmerman).

**✔️ Steps to Analyze Shellbags**
1. Load the Registry Hive
   * Open ShellBagsExplorer
   * Select File → Load Offline Hive
   * Load the USRCLASS.DAT file (contains Shellbags data)

2. Explore the Folder Structure
   * A tree structure appears showing all folders the user interacted with
   * The lower-right panel displays details such as:
     * Folder names
     * Paths
     * Timestamps
     * View modes
     * Bag entries

3. Review timestamps & folder activity
   * Use timestamps to track when folders were viewed
   * Helps identify suspicious or hidden browsing activity
