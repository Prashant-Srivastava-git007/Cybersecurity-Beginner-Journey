### 4️⃣ Configure Splunk for Use

We’ll use the **free trial version**, which allows **up to 500 MB of logs per day**.  
To manage this limit efficiently, it’s a good idea to **disable continuous log collection** until needed.

Steps:
1. Go to **Settings → Data Inputs**  
2. Find **Remote Event Log Collection**  
3. Keep it **Disabled** (turn it on only when doing active analysis)

This prevents unnecessary log ingestion and saves space.
