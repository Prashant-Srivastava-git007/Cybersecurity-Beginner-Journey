# üõ°Ô∏è Sysmon (System Monitor)

**Sysmon (System Monitor)** is a **Windows system service and device driver** that stays active even after system reboots.  
It continuously **monitors and logs system activity** into the **Windows Event Log**.  

Sysmon is one of the most popular tools used in **Windows forensics** and **threat detection** to track suspicious activity such as process creation, network connections, and file modifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

Sysmon provides detailed and powerful event logging capabilities:

- **Logs process creation** with full command-line details (including parent process).
- **Records process image file hashes** (supports SHA1, MD5, SHA256, or IMPHASH).
- **Allows multiple hash algorithms** to be used at the same time.
- **Generates unique Process GUIDs** to correlate events even if Windows reuses process IDs.
- **Adds Session GUIDs** to link all events within the same logon session.
- **Logs loaded drivers or DLLs** along with their signatures and hashes.
- **Logs raw disk or volume read operations** (useful for low-level forensics).
- **Optionally logs all network connections**, including:
  - Source process  
  - IP addresses  
  - Port numbers  
  - Hostnames and port names
- **Detects changes in file creation times** (helps identify timestomping ‚Äî a trick used by malware to hide its tracks).
- **Automatically reloads configuration** if changes are made in the registry.
- **Supports rule-based event filtering** to include or exclude certain logs dynamically.
- **Captures events early in the boot process**, even before most malware can hide.

## üß∞ Installation Guide (Beginner Friendly)

Follow these steps carefully to install and configure Sysmon on your Windows machine:

1. **Download the default Sysmon configuration file**
   - Visit: [Sysmon Modular Config by Olaf Hartong](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)
   - Save it as **`config.xml`**
2. **Unzip the Sysmon ZIP file** you downloaded from Microsoft.
3. **Place the `config.xml` file** inside the **Sysmon folder**.
4. **Move the entire Sysmon folder** to your **C: drive** for easier access.  
   Example: `C:\Sysmon`
5. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**  
   - Press **Windows + S** ‚Üí Type **cmd** ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí **Run as administrator**
6. **Navigate to the Sysmon folder**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Sysmon
   ```
7. Install Sysmon with the configuration file
   ```bash
   sysmon -accepteula -i config.xml
   ```
‚úÖ This command installs Sysmon, accepts the license, and loads your XML configuration.
8. Verify Sysmon is running
   * Open Event Viewer (Run ‚Üí eventvwr.msc)
   * Go to: `Applications and Services Logs ‚Üí Microsoft ‚Üí Windows ‚Üí Sysmon ‚Üí Operational`
     
     If you see multiple Sysmon events appearing, üéâ Sysmon is successfully running!

## üïµÔ∏è Example Use Case (Forensics Context)

Imagine you are investigating a suspicious program on a Windows system.
Sysmon helps you:
* See when and how the program started
* Identify which user or process launched it
* Check its network connections
* Detect any changes to file timestamps

This makes Sysmon a powerful tool for incident response, digital forensics, and malware hunting.
