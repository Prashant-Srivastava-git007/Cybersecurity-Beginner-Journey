# 🛠️ Attack Simulation — Create Forensic Artifacts 

1. **Enable local logging (Splunk)**  
   - Open: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` → Log in.  
   - Settings → **Data Inputs** → enable Windows Event Log and Sysmon (or other inputs you want).

2. **Take a VM snapshot** (clean state).

3. **Run the attack emulation**  
   - Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and change to the ART folder:  
     ```powershell
     cd C:\Path\To\AtomicRedTeam
     ```  
   - Run the attack script (follow prompts):  
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\ART-attack.ps1
     ```  
   - Choose the run option (e.g., `R`) and confirm prompts.
   - Select “Y”
   - Select OK on the pop up.
   - Once the emulation is completed the curser will return and you can close the notepad app that should have started.
   - 

4. **Disable Splunk logging**
  * Go back to Splunk and disable logging the same way you enabled it.
