# 🔎 Filesystem Analysis ($MFT and $J)  — 

This short, beginner-friendly guide explains the NTFS filesystem timestamps, the Master File Table (MFT), and practical hints for forensic analysis. Use this after your Windows Forensics introduction.

## ⏱️ NTFS Timestamps (MACB)
NTFS records several timestamps for each file. These are essential for building timelines:

- **M** — **Modified** (content last changed)  
- **A** — **Accessed** (file was read)  
- **C** — **Metadata Changed** (attributes, permissions, or rename — MFT record updated)  
- **B** — **Birth / Created** (when file was created)

> Note: You will often see these written as **MACB** or **MACB timestamps**.  
> Timestamps can be altered by attackers — always correlate with other artifacts (event logs, Prefetch, Registry).

## 🔐 $STANDARD_INFO vs $FILE_NAME
NTFS stores timestamp and metadata in two different attributes:

- **$STANDARD_INFORMATION ($SI)**  
  - Stores flags, owner SID and **MACB timestamps**.  
  - Can be modified by user-level tools (e.g., timestomp).
- **$FILE_NAME**  
  - Also stores MACB times, file name, and length.  
  - **Only the kernel can modify this.**  
  - Because of that, `$FILE_NAME` timestamps are generally more reliable — attackers rarely can change them without low-level access.

## 🗂️ Master File Table (MFT)
The **MFT** is the NTFS database of all files and folders. Key points:

- **Metadata Storage:** Every file/folder has an MFT record with timestamps, size, attributes, and pointers to file data.  
- **Indexing & Allocation:** Tracks where file data is stored on disk.  
- **MFT Zone:** Area reserved for future MFT growth; fragmentation here can indicate heavy file activity.  
- **Alternate Data Streams (ADS):** Files can have hidden streams (e.g., `file.txt:secret`) that may contain extra data or covert content. ADS are stored via MFT and must be checked.
- **Resilience:** filesystem’s ability to withstand errors, crashes, or corruption and recover so data and metadata remain intact and usable
