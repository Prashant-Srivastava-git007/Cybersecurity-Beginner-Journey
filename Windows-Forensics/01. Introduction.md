# 🧩 Introduction to Windows Forensics

## 🕵️‍♂️ What is Windows Forensics?

**Windows Forensics** is a key part of **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** that focuses on identifying, collecting, and analyzing digital evidence from **Windows-based systems**.  
It helps investigators understand *what happened, how it happened, and who was involved* during a security incident or system compromise.

In simple terms — Windows Forensics is like **digital detective work**. Every action a user or attacker performs leaves traces behind. These traces are known as **artifacts**.

## 🧱 What Are Windows Artifacts?

Windows **forensic artifacts** are data traces automatically generated by the operating system or applications. They are extremely valuable for reconstructing user and attacker activities.  
Below are the most common types of artifacts you’ll learn about:

### 🔹 File System Artifacts
- **$MFT (Master File Table)** – Tracks every file and folder on an NTFS partition.
- **$LogFile and $UsnJrnl** – Record file changes such as creation, modification, or deletion.
- **Recycle Bin** – Stores deleted files temporarily with metadata like deletion time.

### 🔹 Registry Artifacts
- The **Windows Registry** acts like a database storing system and user configuration data.
- Important hives include:
  - `NTUSER.DAT` – User-specific settings such as recent documents and program usage.
  - `SYSTEM` – Contains details about connected devices, system startup, and services.
  - `SOFTWARE` – Records installed applications and system updates.
  - `SAM` – Stores local user accounts and password hashes.

### 🔹 Execution Artifacts
These artifacts show which programs were executed and when:
- **Prefetch Files (.pf)** – Reveal frequently executed applications with timestamps.
- **Shimcache / Amcache** – Record execution history and file metadata.
- **SRUM (System Resource Usage Monitor)** – Tracks app usage, battery data, and network activity.

### 🔹 Persistence & Task Artifacts
Attackers often use built-in mechanisms to maintain access:
- **Startup Folders / Run Keys** – Launch programs automatically when the system boots.
- **Scheduled Tasks** – Run scripts or malware at set intervals.

### 🔹 Network and Log Artifacts
- **Event Logs (EVTX)** – Contain logs for user logins, system errors, and application events.
- **Firewall & DNS Logs** – Help trace external connections and potential C2 communication.

## 🧠 Why Windows Forensics Matters

Windows is the most widely used operating system in both **corporate** and **personal** environments — making it a prime target for attackers.  
Forensic analysis of Windows systems helps analysts:
- Understand *how a breach occurred*.
- Recover deleted or hidden evidence.
- Detect unauthorized user activity.
- Correlate events from multiple systems.
- Strengthen security policies and prevention mechanisms.

In cybersecurity investigations, forensic evidence can determine **whether an insider threat, external attacker, or malware** was responsible — and how to prevent it next time.

## ⚙️ Lab Setup

In this series, all investigations and exercises will be performed in a **Windows Virtual Machine (VM)**.  
We’ll **manually install each forensic tool**, and detailed installation guides will be provided separately for each one.

> **Note:** Always conduct forensic analysis in a **virtual or isolated environment** to avoid damaging your host system or exposing it to malware.

## 🧩 Learning Approach

Each upcoming section will focus on one artifact or evidence source at a time:
1. Learn what the artifact is and where it’s stored.
2. Practice extracting and analyzing it.
3. Interpret its significance in real-world investigations.

> **Tip:** Always verify the authenticity and integrity of forensic images and tools before using them. Forensics is about accuracy, not speed.
