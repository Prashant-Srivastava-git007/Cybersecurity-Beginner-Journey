# 🔍 Windows RecentDocs Practical Lab

---

## 📌 Scenario

To generate RecentDocs artifacts on a Windows system, We will perform common file and folder access actions. These actions create MRU (Most Recently Used) entries in the Windows Registry that can later be analyzed.

### 🔧 Artifact-Generating Actions

Perform the following steps on your Windows VM:

 **▶ Open Common File Types**

Open each of these files 1–2 times (create sample files if needed):

* `.txt` file
* `.pdf` file
* `.docx` or `.xlsx` file
* `.jpg` or `.png` image
* `.zip` file

**▶ Browse Folders**

Open the following folders in File Explorer:

* Documents
* Downloads
* Pictures
* Desktop

**▶ Create & Access New Items**

* Create a new text file → open it
* Create a new folder → open it
* Move a file to another folder → open it again

> ⏳ Wait 1–2 Minutes Give Windows a short moment to write the RecentDocs entries to the Registry.
