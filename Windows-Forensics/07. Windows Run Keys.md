# 🗝️ Windows Run Keys

Run Keys are important Windows Registry locations that control which programs start automatically when the system boots or when a user logs in. They are used by legitimate applications for convenience—but also heavily abused by attackers for persistence.

Understanding and analyzing Run Keys helps identify unauthorized startup programs and detect suspicious activity on a compromised system.

## 🔍 What Are Run Keys?

Run Keys store entries that contain:

* Application Name
* Command or executable path
* Optional execution parameters

When Windows starts or when a user logs in, entries in these keys are executed automatically.

## 📌 Common Run Key Locations

### User-specific Run Keys

Used for programs that run only for the currently logged-in user:

`
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
`

### System-wide Run Keys

Used for programs that run for all users:

`
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
`

## 🛡️ Why Run Keys Matter in Forensics

**Run Keys often reveal:**

* Persistence mechanisms used by malware
* Startup applications (legitimate or suspicious)
* Evidence of tampering or removed entries
* Unexpected or hidden executable paths
* Indicators of unauthorized access

**Attackers may:**

* Add malicious entries
* Modify existing values
* Delete logs or startup entries
* Use registry redirection to hide their presence

This makes Run Key analysis a critical step in any investigation.
