# 🔍 Google Chrome Forensics Guide

Google Chrome stores a significant amount of user activity, making it a valuable source of forensic evidence. This guide explains key Chrome artifacts, where they are stored, and how to examine them using tools like **DB Browser for SQLite** and **Hindsight**.

---

## 📂 Chrome Browser Data Location

Chrome stores its browsing data in:

```
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
```

This directory contains the **History** SQLite database, which holds website visit information, downloads, and user navigation patterns.

---

## 📘 What Chrome History Contains

Chrome’s history database helps analysts identify:

* Websites visited in the last X days
* URLs, page titles, and referrer information
* How many times each site was visited
* Exact timestamps of each visit
* The user profile associated with the activity

Tool used for analysis: **DB Browser for SQLite**

To open the database:
**DB Browser → Open Database → Navigate to the History file in the Default folder**

---

# 🗂️ Important Tables in Chrome’s History Database

## 1. **urls Table**

This table stores general information about visited pages, including:

* URL
* Page title
* Visit count
* Last visit time
* Typed count (how often the URL was manually typed)

This helps identify frequently visited sites and user intent.

---

## 2. **visits Table**

Tracks every individual visit, including:

* Timestamp of the visit
* Transition type (how the user reached the URL)
* Referring visit (previous page in the navigation chain)

This table is essential for reconstructing user browsing behavior.

---

# 🔄 Understanding Transition Types

The **transition field** tells *how* a visit occurred. It contains:

* **Core transition type** (last 8 bits)
* **Qualifiers** (additional attributes)

## 🧩 Core Transition Types

| Decimal | Type              | Description                                      |

|       1 | TYPED             | User manually typed the URL                      |
|       2 | AUTO_BOOKMARK     | Visit triggered from bookmarks                   |
|       3 | AUTO_SUBFRAME     | Visit triggered automatically by iframe/subframe |
|       4 | MANUAL_SUBFRAME   | User manually navigated inside a subframe        |
|       5 | GENERATED         | Visit from keyword search (omnibox)              |
|       6 | START_PAGE        | Visit from browser start page/new tab            |
|       7 | FORM_SUBMIT       | Triggered by form submission                     |
|       8 | RELOAD            | Page reload (button or F5)                       |
|       9 | KEYWORD           | Visit from search engine keyword                 |
|      10 | KEYWORD_GENERATED | Keyword-initiated visit                          |

## 🏷️ Transition Qualifiers

| Decimal Value | Qualifier       | Meaning                                 |
| ------------: | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
|     8,388,608 | CHAIN_START     | Start of a redirect/navigation chain    |
|    16,777,216 | CHAIN_END       | End of a navigation chain               |
|    33,554,432 | CLIENT_REDIRECT | Client-side redirect (JS, meta refresh) |
|    67,108,864 | SERVER_REDIRECT | Server-side redirect (HTTP 3xx)         |

# 🧮 Useful SQLite Queries

### Extract Core Transition Type

```sql
SELECT id, visit_time, transition,
       transition & 0xFF AS core_transition
FROM visits;
```

### Convert Visit Duration to Readable Format

```sql
SELECT id, url, visit_time, visit_duration,
       visit_duration / 1000000 AS duration_seconds,
       (visit_duration / 1000000) / 60 AS duration_minutes,
       (visit_duration / 1000000) % 60 AS duration_mod_seconds,
       printf('%d:%02d',
              (visit_duration / 1000000) / 60,
              (visit_duration / 1000000) % 60) AS formatted_duration
FROM visits;
```

---

# ⏱️ Visit Duration Explained

The `visit_duration` field measures how long (in microseconds) a user stayed on a webpage.
This helps determine **engagement**, **interest level**, or **suspiciously short visits**.

---

# 🔗 Correlating URLs and Visits

For a full understanding of browsing behavior:

* **urls table** → where the user went
* **visits table** → how and when they went there

Cross-referencing these tables gives a complete picture of navigation paths and user intent.

# 🛠️ Chrome Analysis Using Hindsight

**Hindsight** is a browser forensics tool that extracts and parses Chrome (and Edge) history.

### What Hindsight Can Do

* Extract browsing history, cookies, downloads, cache
* Parse SQLite and local storage files
* Generate human-readable reports
* Create timeline views
* Filter and keyword search
* Export data for further analysis
* Supports Chrome + Edge Chromium

---

## ▶️ Running Hindsight

Example command:

```
hindsight.exe -i "C:\Users\<UserName>\Desktop\Kape_Out_browser\C\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data" -o C:\Users\<UserName>\Desktop\Case_Files\WebBrowser\Chrome
```

### Breakdown:

* **hindsight.exe** → The tool
* **-i** → Input directory containing Chrome data
* **-o** → Output directory where the report will be saved

After running the command, Hindsight displays a processing summary.

---

# 📊 Viewing Hindsight Output

1. Open **EZViewer** (found in the EZTools folder).
2. Load the `.xlsx` report generated by Hindsight.
3. Use filters to simplify the view:

   * Filter by **Type** such as `url (visited)` or `downloads`.
   * View timestamps, downloaded files, visit durations, transitions, and more.

This allows quick identification of browsing behavior, suspicious activity, and timeline-based patterns.
