## Hunt Manager

The **Hunt Manager** displays all hunts created and executed across client machines.

### What is a Hunt?

A **hunt** executes one or more artifacts across selected clients.
Artifacts define what data to collect or what actions to perform.

### Creating a New Hunt

* Click the **plus (+)** button to start a new hunt.
* Select which clients to include or exclude (by OS, labels, or custom filters).
* On the **"Select Artifacts"** tab, choose the artifact(s) you want to deploy.
  Velociraptor includes many built-in artifacts covering processes, registry, logs, file system activity, and more.

## View Artifacts

The **View Artifacts** section shows all artifacts available on your server.

Here you can:

* Edit existing artifacts
* Create your own custom artifacts
* Import community artifacts

This feature gives Velociraptor powerful flexibility during investigations.

---

## Server Events

The **Server Events** section contains logs of all operations performed on your Velociraptor server.
These logs help you:

* Monitor server activity
* Track hunt execution
* Troubleshoot issues
* Review historical actions

---

## Server Artifacts & Offline Collectors

**Server Artifacts** are artifacts that run directly on the Velociraptor server instead of client machines.
They are used for:

* Server-side enrichment
* Scheduled background tasks
* Integrations with external systems (SIEM, etc.)
* Creating offline collectors

### What is an Offline Collector?

An **Offline Collector** is a standalone executable you generate to run on machines that are:

* Not connected to the Velociraptor server
* In isolated or air-gapped environments
* Offline during incident response

The collector gathers predefined artifacts and saves the results for later analysis.

---

## Virtual File System (VFS)

The **Virtual File System (VFS)** allows you to:

* Browse a client’s file system remotely
* Navigate folders
* Download suspicious files
* Inspect directories during investigations

For example, if you suspect a malicious executable in the Downloads directory, VFS lets you locate and retrieve it for further analysis.
