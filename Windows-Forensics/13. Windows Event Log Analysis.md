# 🪪 Windows Event Log Analysis 

Windows Event Logs act like **digital footprints** that record almost everything happening on a Windows system. For forensic investigators, these logs help rebuild the story of what occurred—whether it's a login event, application crash, suspicious script execution, or an attempted breach.

## 🔍 What Are Windows Event Logs?

Windows automatically records system, security, and application activity into log files (`.evtx`).  
These logs help investigators understand:

- Who used the system  
- What actions they performed  
- What processes or scripts executed  
- Whether malicious activity occurred

## 📂 Common Types of Event Logs

### **1. Application Logs**
Events created by installed programs (e.g., errors from software).

### **2. Security Logs**
Contains authentication and security-related events, such as:
- Login attempts  
- Privilege use  
- Account creation  

### **3. System Logs**
Records Windows system component events like driver failures or system errors.

### **4. Setup Logs**
Tracks installation-related events.

### **5. Forwarded Events**
Logs collected from other computers—useful in enterprise environments.

### **6. Sysmon Logs**
If Sysmon is installed, it logs:
- Process creation  
- Network connections  
- File creation  
- Registry events  

These provide **deep visibility** into system activity.

### **7. PowerShell Logs**
Tracks:
- Commands executed  
- Scripts run  
- Module loads  

Critical for detecting script-based attacks.

## 🔐 Why Event Logs Matter in Security Investigations

### **Detecting Incidents**
Event logs help identify:
- Unauthorized logins  
- Privilege escalation  
- Suspicious script execution  
- Malware activity  

### **Reconstructing Timelines**
By correlating timestamps across logs, you can recreate:
- How an incident happened  
- What actions occurred before/after  
- How an attacker moved through the system  

### **Spotting Anomalies**
Comparing logs to normal behavior helps detect irregular activity, such as:
- New processes making network calls  
- Unexpected PowerShell commands  
- Unknown executables launching  

### **Correlation with Other Data**
Combine logs with network logs, antivirus alerts, or endpoint data for stronger conclusions.

## ⚙️ Collecting & Exporting Event Logs with EvtxECmd

Tools like **EvtxECmd** (Eric Zimmerman's tool) help extract `.evtx` logs into readable CSV files.

### ✔ Example Command

```bash
EvtxECmd.exe -d "C:\Path\To\Logs" --csv C:\Output\Folder --csvf EventLogs.csv
````

### **Command Breakdown**

* **EvtxECmd.exe** → The parser tool
* **-d** → Directory containing `.evtx` files
* **--csv** → Output folder for results
* **--csvf** → Name of the CSV file

This converts Event Logs into a spreadsheet for easy analysis.
