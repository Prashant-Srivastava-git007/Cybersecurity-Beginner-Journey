# 🔢 Introduction to Hexadecimal (Hex)

## 📝 What is Hexadecimal?
In computing, **hexadecimal** (often shortened to **hex**) is a **base-16 number system**.  
Unlike our regular decimal system (base-10, digits 0-9), hexadecimal uses **16 symbols**:

- **0–9** → represent values zero to nine (same as decimal).
- **A–F** → represent values ten to fifteen:
  - A = 10  
  - B = 11  
  - C = 12  
  - D = 13  
  - E = 14  
  - F = 15  

👉 This makes it easier to **represent large binary values in a compact form**.  
For example:
- Binary `1111` → Hex `F`
- Binary `1010` → Hex `A`

## 💡 Why Hexadecimal is Used
Computers work in **binary (0s and 1s)**, but binary numbers get very long and hard to read.  
Hexadecimal helps by shortening binary data:
- 1 hex digit = **4 bits** (binary digits)
- 2 hex digits = **1 byte (8 bits)**

For example:
- Binary: `11011011` → Hex: `DB`

✅ Hex is **human-readable**, **compact**, and easier to debug than long binary strings.

## 🛠️ What is a Hex Dump?
A **hex dump** is a **textual view of binary data in hexadecimal format**.  
It shows the raw contents of memory, files, or storage devices.  

### 🔍 Common Uses of Hex Dumps:
- 🐞 **Debugging** software or firmware
- 🔎 **Reverse engineering** applications
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Digital forensics** (e.g., investigating deleted or hidden data)
- 💾 Analyzing **file headers** or **network packets**

Example of a simple hex dump: `48 65 6C 6C 6F`
