# 🔐 Introduction to Cryptography

## 📝 What is Cryptography?
**Cryptography** is the **practice and study of techniques for secure communication**.  
Its goal is to protect information from **unauthorized access or alteration**, especially in the presence of adversaries (like hackers or eavesdroppers).

👉 In simple terms: **Cryptography keeps messages secret and safe while they travel from sender to receiver.**

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🔒 Encryption
The process of **converting readable information (plaintext)** into an **unreadable form (ciphertext)** so that unauthorized people cannot understand it.

Example:
``
Plaintext: Hello
Ciphertext: Ifmmp
``


---

### 🔓 Decryption
The reverse process of **converting ciphertext back into plaintext** so the intended recipient can read it.

Example:
``
Ciphertext: Ifmmp
Plaintext: Hello
``


---

### 🔤 ROT13 Cipher
**ROT13** is a simple **substitution cipher** where **each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions after it** in the Latin alphabet.

Example:
``
Plaintext: HELLO
ROT13: URYYB
``

- Applying ROT13 **twice** returns the original text: `ROT13(URYYB) → HELLO`


👉 ROT13 is not considered secure for modern encryption needs, but it’s a great example to understand how substitution ciphers work.

## 🔒 Real-World Applications of Cryptography
- 🔑 **Password protection** (hashing & encryption)
- 🔐 **Secure messaging** (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal)
- 🌐 **Website security** (HTTPS uses cryptographic protocols)
- 📧 **Email encryption**
- 🏦 **Banking transactions**

## 🖥️ Useful Linux Commands for Encoding & Analysis

These commands are commonly used in **cybersecurity, forensics, and debugging** to work with encoded data or file contents.

---

### 🔡 `base64`
The `base64` command lets you **encode or decode** text or file content into **Base64 format**.

#### 🔹 Examples:
```bash
# Encode a text string
echo "Hello" | base64
# Output: SGVsbG8=

# Decode Base64 back to original text
echo "SGVsbG8=" | base64 --decode
# Output: Hello

# Encode the contents of a file
base64 sample.txt > encoded.txt

# Decode Base64 content from a file
base64 --decode encoded.txt > decoded.txt
```

> 👉 Use Case: Helps transfer binary data (like images or files) safely over text-only systems.

---

### 🔤 tr

The tr command is used to translate or replace characters.
It’s especially useful for simple substitution ciphers like ROT13.

```
🔹 Example (ROT13):
Apply ROT13 to text
echo "HELLO" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
# Output: URYYB
```

> 👉 Use Case: Great for text transformation, basic ciphers, or data cleanup.

---

### 🔢 xxd

The xxd command is used to create or reverse a hex dump of a file.
A hex dump shows the raw binary data in hexadecimal format.

```
🔹 Examples:
# Create a hex dump of a file
xxd sample.txt > hexdump.txt

# View hex dump directly in the terminal
xxd sample.txt

# Convert a hex dump back into its original file
xxd -r hexdump.txt > recovered.txt
```

> 👉 Use Case: Commonly used in forensics and reverse engineering to analyze file structures or recover data.
