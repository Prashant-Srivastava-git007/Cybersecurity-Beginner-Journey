# 🔐 Introduction to Cryptography

## 📝 What is Cryptography?
**Cryptography** is the **practice and study of techniques for secure communication**.  
Its goal is to protect information from **unauthorized access or alteration**, especially in the presence of adversaries (like hackers or eavesdroppers).

👉 In simple terms: **Cryptography keeps messages secret and safe while they travel from sender to receiver.**

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🔒 Encryption
The process of **converting readable information (plaintext)** into an **unreadable form (ciphertext)** so that unauthorized people cannot understand it.

Example:
``
Plaintext: Hello
Ciphertext: Ifmmp
``


---

### 🔓 Decryption
The reverse process of **converting ciphertext back into plaintext** so the intended recipient can read it.

Example:
``
Ciphertext: Ifmmp
Plaintext: Hello
``


---

### 🔤 ROT13 Cipher
**ROT13** is a simple **substitution cipher** where **each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions after it** in the Latin alphabet.

Example:
``
Plaintext: HELLO
ROT13: URYYB
``

- Applying ROT13 **twice** returns the original text: `ROT13(URYYB) → HELLO`


👉 ROT13 is not considered secure for modern encryption needs, but it’s a great example to understand how substitution ciphers work.
