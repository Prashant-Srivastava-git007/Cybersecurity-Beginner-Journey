# 🔡 Introduction to Base64 Encoding

## 📝 What is Base64?
**Base64** is an **encoding scheme** that converts **binary data** (like images, files, or text) into **printable text characters**.  
It’s often used when you need to safely send binary data over systems that only handle text (like email or JSON).

👉 The term **"Base64"** comes from the fact that it uses **64 unique characters**:
* A–Z (26 characters)
* a–z (26 characters)
* 0–9 (10 characters)
* and / (2 characters)

Total: **26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64 characters**

## 🔤 How Base64 Works
Base64 transforms binary data into a sequence of these 64 characters.

The process:
1. Take the **text** or **binary data**.
2. Convert each character to its **ASCII code**.
3. Convert the ASCII code to **binary**.
4. Break the binary into **6-bit groups** (since 2⁶ = 64).
5. Map each 6-bit group to one of the 64 Base64 characters.

Example:
`
Text: M
ASCII: 77
Binary: 01001101
Base64: TQ==
`

## 🏷️ Base64 Padding
Base64 often requires **padding**, represented by the `=` symbol.

- Padding ensures the encoded output length is a multiple of **4 characters**.
- For example: `TQ==` → The `==` is padding added to complete the encoding.

## 💡 Why Use Base64?
- 📨 Safely transmit **binary data over text-based protocols** (e.g., email).
- 🌐 Embedding **images or files in HTML/CSS**.
- 🔐 Useful in **data serialization** and **APIs**.

## ⚙️ Example Command (Linux)
You can encode or decode Base64 using terminal commands:

```bash
# Encode text
echo "Hello" | base64

# Decode Base64
echo "SGVsbG8=" | base64 --decode
```
