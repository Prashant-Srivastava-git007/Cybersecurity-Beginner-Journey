### 4️⃣ Configure Splunk for Use

We’ll use the **free trial version**, which allows **up to 500 MB of logs per day**.  
To manage this limit efficiently, it’s a good idea to **disable continuous log collection** until needed.

Steps:
1. Go to **Settings → Data Inputs**  
2. Find **Remote Event Log Collection**  
3. Keep it **Disabled** (turn it on only when doing active analysis)

This prevents unnecessary log ingestion and saves space.

## 🔎 Testing Splunk (Beginner Verification)

Now that Splunk is set up, let’s test if it’s working properly.

### Step 1 – Generate a Log
Open **Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
ipconfig
```
This command displays your system’s network configuration and generates logs that Splunk can detect.

### Step 2 – Search Logs in Splunk

1. Go to the Splunk Search & Reporting App from the main dashboard.
2. In the search bar, type: `ipconfig`
3. Press Enter.

If Splunk shows results related to your command, ✅ congratulations — Splunk is successfully installed and working!
