## Splunk Core Components

### 1. Splunk Forwarder
The **Splunk Forwarder** is a lightweight agent installed on systems where data is generated.  
Its main role is to **collect data and send it to Splunk** with minimal impact on system performance.

**Common data sources:**
- Web servers (web traffic logs)
- Windows systems (Event Logs, PowerShell, Sysmon)
- Linux systems (system and application logs)
- Databases (connections, queries, errors)

---

### 2. Splunk Indexer
The **Indexer** receives data from forwarders and processes it.

**What it does:**
- Parses and normalizes raw data
- Converts data into searchable events (field–value format)
- Stores data efficiently for fast searching

The indexer is the backbone of data storage and search performance.

### 3. Splunk Search Head
The **Search Head** is the user interface where searches are performed.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Provides access to the Search & Reporting app
- Accepts user searches written in SPL (Search Processing Language)
- Sends queries to indexers and displays results
