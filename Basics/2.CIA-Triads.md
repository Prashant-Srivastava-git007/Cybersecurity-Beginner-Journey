# 🔐 CIA Triad – The Foundation of Cybersecurity

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in cybersecurity used to guide policies and practices that protect information systems.

---

## 🔒 1. Confidentiality
Ensuring that only authorized people can access sensitive data.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Password protection
- Data encryption
- Access control (e.g., user roles)

---

## 📑 2. Integrity
Ensuring that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered unless authorized.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Checksums and hashing
- Version control
- File permission rules

---

## 🟢 3. Availability
Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.

### 🔹 Examples:
- Server uptime and redundancy
- Backups and recovery plans
- DDoS protection

## 💡 Why It Matters

Every cybersecurity measure you take should support at least one part of the CIA triad.  
A system is only secure if it protects **confidentiality**, maintains **integrity**, and ensures **availability**.
