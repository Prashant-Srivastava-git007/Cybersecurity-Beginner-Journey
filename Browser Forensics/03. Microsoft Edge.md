# 🧭 Microsoft Edge Forensics Guide (Chromium-Based Edge)

Microsoft Edge was originally built using the **EdgeHTML** engine, but in 2018 Microsoft transitioned Edge to a **Chromium-based browser**. This major shift brought significant improvements in compatibility, performance, and forensic artifact structure.

## 🔄 Why Microsoft Switched Edge to Chromium

### 1. **Chromium Rendering Engine**

Chromium is the open-source engine behind Google Chrome.
By adopting it, Edge now shares:

* The same rendering engine
* The same extension platform
* Similar internal file structures

### 2. **Better Web Compatibility**

Most websites are optimized for Chromium.
The transition reduced:

* Page rendering issues
* Feature compatibility problems
* Web application failures

### 3. **Support for Chrome Extensions**

Chromium-based Edge allows installation of:

* Chrome Web Store extensions
* Edge Add-ons from Microsoft

This gives users and investigators **much better extension visibility**.

### 4. **Faster Updates**

Using Chromium lets Microsoft:

* Push updates faster
* Reuse Chromium’s security improvements
* Focus on UI & experience rather than engine development

### 5. **Cross-Platform Support**

Chromium made Edge available on:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux
* Mobile platforms

## 📂 Edge Browser Data Location

Chromium-based Edge stores its artifacts here:

```
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default
```

This is the same structure used by Chrome, making many of Chrome’s forensic techniques applicable.

---

## 📘 What Edge Stores in Its History Database

Just like Chrome, Edge stores:

* Browsing history
* Page titles
* Visit timestamps
* Number of visits
* Referrer URLs
* Typed URLs
* Download history
* Cookies
* Login information (if saved)
* Extensions data

These artifacts help reconstruct user activity and timeline.

## 🗂️ Analyzing Edge Using DB Browser for SQLite

Edge stores browsing activity in SQLite databases (e.g., `History`, `Cookies`, `Login Data`).

To inspect them:

1. Open **DB Browser for SQLite**
2. Select **Open Database**
3. Navigate to:

```
AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default
```

Useful databases include:

| Database File   | Contains                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **History**     | URLs, visits, downloads                |
| **Top Sites**   | Most visited sites                     |
| **Cookies**     | Session tokens, authentication cookies |
| **Login Data**  | Saved credentials                      |
| **Web Data**    | Autofill, form history                 |
| **Preferences** | Browser configuration & extensions     |

All tables behave similarly to their Chrome counterparts because both use Chromium.

## 🛠️ Analyzing Edge Using Hindsight

**Hindsight** is a browser forensic tool supporting Chrome & Chromium-based Edge.

### ▶️ Example Command (Edge)

```powershell
hindsight.exe -i "C:\Users\Elliot\Desktop\Kape_Out\C\Users\Elliot\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default" -o C:\Users\Elliot\Desktop\Case_Files\WebBrowser\Edge
```

### What the Command Does

* **-i** → Input folder containing extracted Edge data
* **-o** → Output folder where reports will be stored
* Output includes **CSV** and **Excel** files for easy review

Hindsight parses:

* URL visits
* Download history
* Transition types
* Visit durations
* Cookies
* Searches
* Extensions
* Auto-fill entries
* And more

---

## 📊 Reviewing the Output With EZViewer

1. Open **EZViewer** (inside the EZTools folder)
2. Load the Hindsight-generated `.xlsx` or `.csv` file
3. Use filters to isolate important fields such as:

   * `url (visited)`
   * `downloads`
   * `search terms`
   * `extensions`
   * `cookies`

Filtering helps reduce noise and focus on relevant data during investigations.

## 📌 Additional Notes 

### ✔ Edge and Chrome Share the Same Core Artifacts

Because both use Chromium, you can use **the same techniques**, **queries**, and **tools** to analyze:

* URLs
* Visits tables
* Cookies
* Login Data
* Extensions

### ✔ Cross-Table Correlation Works the Same

You can correlate:

* `urls` + `visits`
* `downloads` + `visit_time`
* `cookies` + site visits

### ✔ Transition Types, Visit Duration, and Event Reconstruction

Edge’s database also includes:

* `transition` field
* `visit_duration`
* referrer visit IDs

Identical to Chrome’s schema.
