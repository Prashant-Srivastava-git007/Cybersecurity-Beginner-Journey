# 🔍 Mozilla Firefox Forensic Artifacts Guide

Mozilla Firefox stores most user browsing artifacts inside the following directory:

```
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<ProfileFolder>\
```

This folder contains multiple SQLite databases, JSON files, and session data useful for browser forensics.

## 🛠 Viewing Firefox SQLite Artifacts

Most Firefox databases (e.g., `places.sqlite`, `cookies.sqlite`, `favicons.sqlite`) can be opened using:

* **DB Browser for SQLite**
* **SQLiteStudio**
* Any forensic browser artifact parser

These tools allow you to view tables such as `moz_places`, `moz_historyvisits`, `moz_cookies`, etc.

# 🔎 BrowsingHistoryView (NirSoft)

**BrowsingHistoryView** is a lightweight tool that extracts browsing history from multiple browsers, including:

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer
* Safari (if installed)

### ✅ Key Features

* Extracts history records (URLs, visit time, visit count, referrer, etc.)
* Supports filtering (date range, keyword, browser type)
* Exports results to **HTML, CSV, XML, or TXT**
* Portable — runs without installation
* Combines history from multiple browsers into one view

---

## ▶️ How to Use BrowsingHistoryView

1. Download BrowsingHistoryView (64-bit or 32-bit) from NirSoft.
2. Extract the folder and run:

```
BrowsingHistoryView.exe
```

3. In the “Load History From” options:

   * Select **Load history from the specified profiles folder**.
4. Choose the directory containing the browser profile data
   (e.g., collected via KAPE or directly from a live system).
5. Click **OK** to load and display history records.

BrowsingHistoryView will now show combined history from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc., including timestamps and URL metadata.

## ⭐ Additional Notes 

* Firefox may create **multiple profiles**; choose the one with the most recent timestamps.
* Some files (like saved passwords) are **encrypted** and require Windows account context to decrypt.
* Jsonlz4 session files can be decompressed using tools like **Firefox Decrypt** or **Mozilla’s lz4 libraries**.
* Always make a **copy** of the profile folder before analysis to avoid modifying timestamps.
