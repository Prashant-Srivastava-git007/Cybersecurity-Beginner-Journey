# üîê Cryptography ‚Äî Hashing (Intro)

## üß© What is Hashing?
**Hashing** is the process of converting arbitrary-length data (like a file or message) into a **fixed-size string of bits** called a **hash** or **digest**.  
A hash function takes input data and produces a unique-looking output (the hash) that represents the original data.

### üîé Key properties
- **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same hash.  
- **Fixed length:** Regardless of input size, the hash output size is constant (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit).  
- **Fast to compute:** Hash functions are designed to be efficient.  
- **One-way (hard to reverse):** You should not be able to reconstruct the original input from the hash.  
- **Collision resistance (ideally):** It should be hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash. *Note:* "hard" ‚Äî not impossible.

> ‚ùó Important correction: it is **not true** that two different files can *never* generate the same hash (a collision). For any fixed-size hash there are infinitely many inputs, so collisions *must* exist in theory. Good hash functions make finding collisions computationally infeasible.

## üîß Common Uses of Hashing
- **Integrity verification:** Check whether a file or message was altered.  
- **Digital signatures:** Hash the message first, then sign the hash.  
- **Password storage / verification:** Store hashed passwords (ideally with salts and slow hash functions).  
- **Data deduplication / indexing:** Quick checks for identical content.

## üßæ Example: MD5
- **MD5** (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) produces a **128-bit** hash value.  
- Designed by **Ronald Rivest (1991)** and widely used historically for checksums and integrity checks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security note about MD5
- MD5 is now considered **cryptographically broken** and **unsuitable** for security-sensitive uses (like digital signatures or password hashing) because practical collisions have been demonstrated.
- **Do not** use MD5 for new systems where security matters. Prefer modern hashes like **SHA-256** (or better) and use proper techniques (salting, peppering, and slow KDFs like bcrypt/Argon2 for passwords).
