## 🧠 What is Phishing?

**Phishing** is a cyberattack where attackers send **fake emails or messages** that appear to come from trusted sources.  
Their goal is to steal sensitive information (like passwords or bank details) or infect your system with malware.

Phishing relies on **social engineering** — manipulating human emotions like fear, urgency, or curiosity — rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities.

### 🔹 Common Types of Phishing
- **Email Phishing:** Fake emails from trusted-looking senders (banks, companies, etc.).
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted emails sent to specific people (like employees).
- **Whaling:** Targeted at high-profile individuals such as CEOs or executives.

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. The attacker creates a **convincing message** (often mimicking real organizations).  
2. They include **malicious links or attachments**.  
3. Victims click or provide sensitive information.  
4. Attackers **steal data**, gain access, or deliver **malware**.

## 🧩 Anatomy of a Phishing Attack

| Stage | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **The Hook** | Gets your attention through urgency or fear | “Your account will be locked in 24 hours!” |
| **The Bait** | Fake link or file to make you act | A link that looks like your bank’s website |
| **The Payload** | What happens when you fall for it | Malware installed or credentials stolen |
| **The Aftermath** | Attackers use your info for fraud or breaches | Financial loss, identity theft, or corporate compromise |

## 🧨 Real-World Examples

### 🏦 Target Data Breach (2013)
A third-party vendor clicked a phishing link, allowing attackers to steal login credentials.  
This led to one of the largest retail data breaches, exposing over **40 million customers’** payment card details.

### 👔 John Podesta Email Hack (2016)
A fake “Google security alert” tricked a U.S. political campaign chairman into entering his password on a fake site — leading to massive data leaks.

### 📄 Google Docs Phishing Attack (2017)
Attackers sent fake Google Docs invites. Clicking the link gave them access to victims’ Gmail accounts, allowing the scam to spread further.

> 💡 **Lesson:** Even trusted platforms can be used in phishing campaigns.

## 🔍 How to Recognize a Phishing Email

Look for these **common red flags**:

- **Suspicious sender:** Slightly misspelled or unusual domains (e.g., `@gmaill.com`).  
- **Urgency:** “Act now or lose access!” type messages.  
- **Unexpected attachments:** Especially `.zip`, `.exe`, or macro-enabled Office files.  
- **Fake URLs:** Hover your mouse over links before clicking — check if they redirect to unrelated sites.

## 🛡️ Staying Safe

- **Think before clicking:** Pause if an email feels urgent or emotional.  
- **Verify sender identity:** Contact the organization directly using official channels.  
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Even if your password is stolen, MFA helps protect you.  
- **Stay updated:** Regular awareness training reduces the success of phishing attacks.
